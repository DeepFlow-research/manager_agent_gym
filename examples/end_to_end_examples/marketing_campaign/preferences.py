Renewable Energy Marketing â€“ Preferences, Evaluators, and Weight Updates

Preferences modeled for an integrated campaign:
  - performance  : pipeline efficacy & experimentation rigor
  - brand        : brand lift & message coherence
  - compliance   : environmental claims substantiation + privacy/email rules
  - accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA readiness

Mirrors example schema usage:

  * Rubric(aggregation=AggregationStrategy.WEIGHTED_AVERAGE, criteria=[RubricCriteria...])
  * RubricCriteria with llm_prompt or evaluator_function
