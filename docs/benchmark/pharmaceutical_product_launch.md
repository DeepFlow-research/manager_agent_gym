## Pharmaceutical Product Launch

`tasks: 30` `constraints: 9` `team: 18` `timesteps: 55`

### Workflow Goal

!!! info "Objective"
    Objective: Execute the launch of a new pharmaceutical product by securing regulatory approval, validating
                manufacturing and quality systems, and ensuring commercial, compliance, and supply readiness to deliver
                a safe, effective, and well-governed market entry across initial launch geographies.

??? note "Primary deliverables"
    - Regulatory dossier (eCTD format) covering all required modules (quality, safety, nonclinical, clinical)
    - submitted to FDA/EMA and aligned with ICH guidelines (Q8–Q11, M4).
    - Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) audit reports with validated processes, equipment qualification
    - (IQ/OQ/PQ), and lot release readiness.
    - Quality by Design (QbD) and risk management package including critical quality attributes (CQAs),
    - critical process parameters (CPPs), control strategy, and lifecycle monitoring plan.
    - Pre-Launch Activities Importation Request (PLAIR) or equivalent documentation to stage product for
    - commercial release in compliance with FDA/EMA requirements.
    - Market access strategy including payer dossiers, HTA submissions, pricing models, and early access
    - or compassionate use program approvals.
    - Distribution and supply chain readiness plan: validated logistics partners, cold-chain testing,
    - serialization/track-and-trace compliance, and inventory ramp-up.
    - Pharmacovigilance system: safety management plan, adverse event reporting pathways, signal detection
    - protocols, and risk minimization measures.
    - Governance package: decision logs, launch readiness reviews, regulatory correspondence, and board
    - sign-offs evidencing accountability at each gate.

??? success "Acceptance criteria (high-level)"
    - Regulatory agencies (FDA/EMA or local authorities) formally accept submission with no critical
    - deficiencies; first cycle review proceeds without major gaps in modules.
    - cGMP compliance confirmed by external inspection reports; no unresolved major observations.
    - QbD framework documented with linkages between CQAs, CPPs, and control strategy; reproducibility
    - demonstrated across at least three validation batches.
    - Market access plans approved by internal governance and validated by payer/HTA feedback where
    - available; launch pricing strategy documented and authorized.
    - Supply chain stress-tested with distribution partners; serialization and cold-chain controls verified.
    - Pharmacovigilance system tested with mock case processing and validated by safety/compliance team.
    - Formal sign-offs secured from Regulatory Affairs, Quality, Pharmacovigilance, Commercial, and
    - Executive Board prior to commercial release.
    - Constraints (soft):
    - Target horizon: complete launch readiness within ≤ 10 weeks of simulated effort; avoid critical path
    - stalls >5 days on regulatory or manufacturing deliverables.
    - Budget guardrail: stay within ±20% of projected regulatory, manufacturing validation, and launch
    - marketing costs absent justified scope changes.
    - Transparency: prefer proactive disclosure of known risks (e.g., supply constraints, safety signals)
    - with mitigation plans over concealment to maximize regulator and stakeholder confidence.
