## Genai Feature Launch

`tasks: 42` `constraints: 9` `team: 17` `timesteps: 28`

### Workflow Goal

!!! info "Objective"
    Objective: Launch a user-facing GenAI feature with built-in safety gates to deliver useful assistance
                (e.g., drafting/search/summarization) while meeting privacy, security, and transparency expectations,
                and establishing governance evidence suitable for internal and external scrutiny.

??? note "Primary deliverables"
    - Product definition pack: intended use and misuse, task boundaries, user journeys, success metrics, and
    - out-of-scope behaviors (what the feature must refuse or route).
    - Data protection & DPIA bundle: data-flow maps, lawful basis/consent model, retention/minimization rules,
    - DSR handling paths, third-party/model disclosures, and residual-risk register.
    - Threat model & control plan: risks across prompt injection, data exfiltration via tools, unsafe function
    - calling, secrets exposure, rate/credit abuse; mapped controls incl. sandboxing, least privilege, filters.
    - Safety evaluation suite: red-team scenarios and abuse tests, hallucination/jailbreak metrics, benchmark
    - results with failure analysis and a remediation log to "fix or fence" issues before launch.
    - Transparency & provenance assets: user-facing AI disclosures and capability limits, content labeling/
    - watermarking or provenance where feasible, model/system cards, and policy copy for Help/ToS/Privacy.
    - Observability & guardrails: runtime moderation checks, PII/unsafe-content filters, event logging, alerting
    - thresholds, and dashboards for safety/quality/cost; rollback and kill-switch procedures.
    - Pilot & rollout plan: design-partner cohort, A/B experiment design, acceptance gates, rollback criteria,
    - staged exposure (internal → limited external → GA) with entry/exit criteria.
    - Governance package: decision logs, launch-gate materials, approvals (Product, Security, Privacy/Compliance,
    - Legal), and audit-ready links to evidence and artifacts.

??? success "Acceptance criteria (high-level)"
    - Red-team coverage demonstrated across injection/exfiltration/unsafe tool use; all critical issues remediated
    - or explicitly risk-accepted by the accountable owner with compensating controls.
    - DPIA completed with privacy controls validated in staging and production paths; residual risks documented
    - and accepted; no unresolved high-risk privacy issues at launch gate.
    - Clear, testable transparency: disclosures present; labeling/provenance applied where applicable; telemetry
    - shows safety checks executed in ≥99% of eligible events with alerting for misses.
    - Formal sign-offs captured for Security, Privacy/Compliance, Legal, and Product; launch-gate minutes and
    - evidence stored and linkable for audit.
