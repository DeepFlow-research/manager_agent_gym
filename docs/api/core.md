## Core Systems

The core namespace exposes the runtime building blocks that orchestrate workflows in
Manager Agent Gym. Use the sections below to understand each component before diving
into the full API reference generated by mkdocstrings.

### Workflow Execution

`WorkflowExecutionEngine` advances the simulation timestep-by-timestep, manages task
queues, and gathers metrics for analysis.

::: manager_agent_gym.core.execution.engine.WorkflowExecutionEngine

### Manager Agents

`ManagerAgent` is the abstract contract for decision-making managers. Implement custom
manager strategies by inheriting from this base class.

::: manager_agent_gym.core.manager_agent.interface.ManagerAgent

### Worker Interfaces

`AgentInterface` specifies the capabilities worker agents must expose. Concrete AI and
human simulations live under `manager_agent_gym.core.workflow_agents`.

::: manager_agent_gym.core.workflow_agents.interface.AgentInterface

### Agent Registry

`AgentRegistry` tracks available agents and provides helpers for registering them with
an execution engine.

::: manager_agent_gym.core.workflow_agents.registry.AgentRegistry

### Communication Service

`CommunicationService` stores threaded conversations and broadcasts between agents and
stakeholders throughout a run.

::: manager_agent_gym.core.communication.service.CommunicationService
