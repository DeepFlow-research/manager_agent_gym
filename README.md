## üéØ Overview

Manager Agent Gym implements the **Autonomous Manager Agent** research challenge described in ["Orchestrating Human-AI Teams: The Manager Agent as a Unifying Research Challenge for Distributed AI"](paper.md). This platform provides a complete implementation of the formal POSG (Partially Observable Stochastic Game) framework for building and evaluating autonomous workflow management systems.

### What is the Manager Agent Challenge?

The Manager Agent is an autonomous entity responsible for end-to-end management of complex workflows within dynamic, multi-agent environments. It must:

- üß© **Decompose complex goals** into executable task graphs using hierarchical reasoning
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balance competing objectives** (cost, quality, time) under changing preferences  
- ü§ù **Coordinate ad hoc teams** of human and AI workers without prior joint training
- üìã **Maintain governance compliance** while adapting to evolving constraints

This challenge serves as a unifying research problem that bridges multiple AI sub-fields: multi-agent coordination, compositional reasoning, preference learning, and AI governance.

async def main():
    # Create workflow and agent registry
    workflow = create_toy_workflow_example()
    agent_registry = AgentRegistry()
    
    # Register agents from the workflow
    for agent in workflow.agents.values():
        agent_registry.register_agent(agent)
    
    # Create manager agent with preferences
    preferences = create_basic_preferences()
    manager = ChainOfThoughtManagerAgent(
        preferences=preferences,
        model_name="o3",
        manager_persona="Organized Project Coordinator",
    )
    
    # Set up execution engine
    engine = WorkflowExecutionEngine(

## üß© Core Architecture

### POSG Implementation

The system implements the formal framework `‚ü®I, S, b‚Å∞, {A·µ¢}, {O·µ¢}, P, {R·µ¢}‚ü©`:

- **I (Agents)**: Manager + Worker agent implementations
- **S (State)**: `Workflow` containing tasks, resources, agents, messages  
- **A·µ¢ (Actions)**: `BaseManagerAction` hierarchy for manager decisions
- **O·µ¢ (Observations)**: `ManagerObservation` for partial state visibility
- **P (Transitions)**: `WorkflowExecutionEngine` manages state evolution
- **R·µ¢ (Rewards)**: Multi-objective evaluation via `ValidationEngine` and regret analysis
